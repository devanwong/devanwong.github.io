                        <h1>Hi! I'm Devan.</h1>
                        <p>I am currently an email developer, looking to turn into a web developer. I have been in the email development world for over 5 years, though I love the work that I do, I am ready to take on new challenges.</p>

                        <h1>Growing up.</h1>
                        <p>I grew up in the Bay Area my entire life. I was born in Oakland, raised in Richmond, went to college in San Jose, and now work in Sunnyvale. Growing up, I played sports year round. Started off as a basketball player, then eventually steered towards volleyball. I was a pure definition of a tomboy. When college came around, I know that I wanted to be an art major. With social media becoming more and more popular, I was truly addicted with the way something looks and how it works. So when I went to San Jose State, did a double major, one in graphic design and the other in digital media arts. However, after college, it sort of took a 180 turn, and needed to find a job. I knew I wasn't ready for the tech world, so I took a job on Craigslist for a project manager position. Though this was not a bread winning job, this really taught me some core strengths such as business sales, professional communication and a key component o organization. After a few years as a project manager, I realized that I really wanted to go back to school and learn how to code. I had a small understanding of HTML and CSS thanks to Myspace, but I learn wants to take it to the next level. I knew that going back to college, was not ideal, because of the time. So I decided to invest in enrolling in a bootcamp. This bootcamp, Coding Dojo is a 6-week accelerated bootcamp that teaches you how to become a full-stack developer. After I was done, it took me 6 months before I landed my first job, with Google. Well, a contractor through Google. That's how I became a email developer, and have been doing that ever since.</p>

                        <h1>Life during the pandemic.</h1>
                        <p>2020, was suppose to be a big year for everyone, including myself. This is my last year in my 20's so I had high goals to set this year. One being to move across the country to New York. However, though this pandemic has been hard on many lives. I was able to focus on at least one goal, which is get my Bachelors of Science in web development. I want to take the time to truly understand the fundamentals of becoming a web developer. Outside of learning, I invested in a Peloton which is nicknamed #BlackMamba. I have taken up of being a true plant mom. When California, isn't burning I love nature and going on long and challenging hikes. Once this pandemic is over with though, I hope continue travel and collect tattoos all over my leg!
